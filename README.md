Advanced CSS Course - Jonas Schmedtmann on udemy.com. 

I used git version control for this course.

The course creates a website with a great look and feel using the BEM model to define classes and 7-1 CSS architecture with Sass to define structure. While maybe not necessary on a small landing page like this it was great to teach me the benefits of Sass. 

The web page includes a float layout rather than css grid or flexbox and has animations created purely with HTML and CSS. (no javaScript)
These animations include animated cards, pop outs, background videos and more.
